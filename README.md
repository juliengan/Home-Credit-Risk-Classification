Report  :


Part 1: Building an ML Project for Home Credit Risk Classification

The ML model for home credit risk classification has been built using the provided dataset. Best practices for production ready code were followed, including:

GIT was used for team collaboration and code and model versioning
The ML project workflow was separated into different scripts for data preparation, training, prediction, visualize, pipeline.
A documentation library, such as Sphinx, was used
The Xgboost was chosen, with the goal of following best practices for production ready code.
Pickle was used to save a trained machine learning model to a file, so that it can be loaded and used again later

Part 2: Integrating MLFlow Library into the Project

MLFlow was installed in the python environment and added to the library requirements
Parameters and metrics of the model were tracked and the results were displayed in the local MLFlow UI for multiple runs
The code was packaged in a reusable and reproducible model format with MLFlow projects

Part 3: Integrating SHAP Library into the Project

SHAP was installed in the python environment and added to the library requirements
SHAP was used to explain model predictions 
Visualizations were created to show explanations for specific points of the dataset, for all points of the dataset at once
